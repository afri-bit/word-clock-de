So here is the list of necessary materials:
* `500 x 500 x 16 mm` particle board
* `500 x 500 x 3 mm` board (the material can be seen from the back cover of one of the IKEA's cupboard)
* `500 x 500 x 3 mm` acryl glass
* `500 x 500 x 45 mm` IKEA Ribba picture frame

To build the project to need following equipments:
* Soldering iron
* Soldering pump - Everyone makes mistakes ;)
* Wire stripper
* Carving knife
* Cutting mat
* Drill machine

### Software
All the software and drivers are written in `Python` programming language.
